Ingredients:
1 unit yellow onion
10 oz ground beef
1 unit tex-mex paste
1 tbsp southwest spice blend
6 unit flour tortillas
1/2 cup mexican cheese blend
1 unit lime
1 unit roma tomato
4 tbsp sour cream
2 tsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp olive oil
salt

Instructions:
Prep
1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and brush with oil or coat with nonstick spray. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 1 TBSP (2 TBSP for 4 servings).

Make Filling
1. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion; cook for 3 minutes.
2. Add beef * and Southwest Spice; cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until beef is browned and onion is softened, 4-6 minutes.
3. Stir in Tex-Mex paste and 1/3 cup water (1/2 cup for 4 servings). Simmer until mixture is thickened and beef is cooked through, 2-4 minutes more. Turn off heat.

Bake Flautas
1. Meanwhile, drizzle tortillas with 1 TBSP olive oil (2 TBSP for 4 servings); brush or rub to completely coat.
2. Place tortillas on a clean work surface. Once beef filling is done, add a heaping 1/4 cup filling to one side of each tortilla, then sprinkle each with 1 TBSP Mexican cheese. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, to create flautas. Place seam sides down on prepared sheet. TIP: Make sure the flautas are snug on the sheet—this will prevent them from unrolling.
3. Bake on middle rack until golden brown and crispy, 8-12 minutes.

Finish & Serve
1. While flautas bake, finely dice tomato. Zest and quarter lime. In a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion, half the lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt.
2. In a separate small bowl, combine sour cream, remaining lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt.
3. Divide flautas between plates. Top with pico de gallo and lime crema. Serve.
