### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup shortening
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar

- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flower

### Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350F. In a large bowl, beat shortening and peanut butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds.
2. Add 1/2 cup granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda. Beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.
