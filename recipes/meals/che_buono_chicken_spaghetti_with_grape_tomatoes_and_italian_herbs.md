### Ingredients:
- 4 oz grape tomatoes
- 2 unit scallions
- 1 clove garlic
- 10 oz chicken breast strips
- 1 tbsp italian seasoning
- 6 oz spaghetti
- 4 oz cream sauce base
- 2 tbsp cream cheese
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
- salt
- pepper
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter

### Instructions:
#### Prep:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Halve tomatoes lengthwise. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince or grate garlic.

#### Cook Chicken:
1. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with half the Italian Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper.
2. Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.
3. Turn off heat; transfer chicken to a plate. Wipe out pan.

#### Cook Pasta:
1. Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes (you’ll start the tomatoes after 5 minutes).
2. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain well.

#### Cook Veggies:
1. Once spaghetti has cooked 5 minutes, melt 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes, scallion whites, and garlic; cook until garlic and scallions are softened and fragrant, 1-2 minutes. TIP: If mixture begins to brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium.

#### Make Sauce:
1. Reduce heat under pan with tomato mixture to medium. Add cream sauce base and remaining Italian Seasoning. TIP: Cut top off cream sauce base carton to open fully; transfer contents, using a spoon or spatula to scrape sauce from carton sides.
2. Stir in cream cheese and bring to a simmer; cook until melted and combined. Season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish & Serve:
1. Add drained spaghetti and chicken to pan with sauce; stir until coated and creamy, adding splashes of reserved pasta cooking water as needed. Stir in half the Parmesan and season with salt and pepper.
2. Divide chicken spaghetti between bowls. Sprinkle with scallion greens and remaining Parmesan and serve.
