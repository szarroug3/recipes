Add reserved spice mixture and 3 cloves garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes. Simmer for 15 minutes, then puree.
5. Stir in cream and cilantro. Season to taste with salt, more cumin, lemon, etc, then add broiled chicken and cook over low heat for 10 minutes, until chicken is fully cooked through.
