### Ingredients:
- 1 clove garlic
- 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
- 1 tbsp italian seasoning
- 6 oz spaghetti
- 10 oz chicken cutlets
- 2 tbsp sour cream
- 14 oz marinara sauce
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 tsp cooking oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- salt
- pepper

### Instructions:
#### Prep:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce.
2. Peel and mince garlic.
3. In a shallow dish, combine panko, half the Parmesan, half the Italian Seasoning (you’ll use the rest of each later), a large drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
4. Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water (1 cup for 4 servings), then drain. Keep empty pot handy for step 4.

#### Prep: & Cook Chicken:
1. While pasta cooks, pat chicken* dry with paper towels; place between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap. Pound with a mallet or rolling pin until chicken is about 1/2 inch thick. Season all over with salt and pepper. TIP: If your cutlets are already 1/2 inch thick, you can skip the pounding.
2. Brush chicken all over with sour cream. Working one piece at a time, press chicken into panko mixture to fully coat.

#### Cook Chicken:
1. Heat a 1/3-inch layer of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat.
2. Once oil is shimmering and hot enough that a pinch of panko mixture sizzles when added to the pan, add chicken. Cook until crust is golden brown and chicken is cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. (Discard any leftover panko mixture on dish.) TIP: Reduce heat if chicken begins to brown too quickly.
3. Transfer chicken to a baking sheet.

#### Make Sauce:
1. Meanwhile, heat a large drizzle of oil in pot used for pasta over medium heat. Add garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, 1 minute.
2. Stir in marinara, remaining Italian Seasoning, 1 tsp sugar, 1/4 cup reserved pasta cooking water, and 2 TBSP butter. (For 4 servings, use 2 tsp sugar, 1/2 cup reserved pasta cooking water, and 3 TBSP butter.) Season generously with salt and pepper.
3. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup sauce (1/2 cup for 4).

#### Mix Pasta:
1. Stir drained spaghetti into pot with sauce; toss to combine. (TIP: If necessary, add more pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is thoroughly coated in sauce.) Remove pot from heat.

#### Finish & Serve:
1. Heat broiler to high. Spread reserved sauce over chicken, then sprinkle with mozzarella. Broil until cheese has melted, 1-3 minutes. TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning.
2. Divide spaghetti between plates and top with chicken Parm. Garnish with remaining Parmesan and serve.
