### Ingredients:
- 12 oz yukon gold potatoes
- 2.5 oz celery
- 1/4 oz thyme
- 2 tbsp sour cream
- 1.5 oz tomato paste
- 1 tbsp flour
- 1/2 cup white cheddar cheese
- 3 oz carrot
- 1 unit yellow onion
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 10 oz ground beef
- 2 unit beef stock concentrate
- 1 tbsp cooking oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- salt
- pepper

### Instructions:
#### Prep:
1. Heat broiler to high. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Dice potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Trim, peel, and halve carrot lengthwise; slice crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick half-moons. Finely dice celery. Halve, peel, and finely chop onion. Strip thyme leaves from stems; roughly chop leaves.

#### Make Mashed Potatoes:
1. Place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes.
2. Drain and return potatoes to pot. Mash with sour cream, 2 TBSP butter (3 TBSP for 4 servings), and 1 tsp chopped thyme until smooth and creamy, adding splashes of water as needed. Season generously with salt and pepper.
3. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

#### Start Filling:
1. While potatoes cook, heat a drizzle of oil in a medium, preferably ovenproof, pan (for 4 servings, use a large, preferably ovenproof, pan) over medium-high heat. Add carrot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes.
2. Add celery, onion, and a large drizzle of oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until veggies are just tender, 5-7 minutes. TIP: If veggies begin to brown too quickly, add a splash of water.
3. Stir in garlic powder and 2 tsp chopped thyme; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.

#### Cook Beef:
1. Add beef* to pan with veggies and season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.
2. Add tomato paste and flour; cook, stirring, until thoroughly combined, 1 minute.

#### Finish Filling:
1. Gradually pour 1/2 cup water (3/4 cup for 4 servings) into pan with beef mixture.
2. Stir in stock concentrates and bring to a boil. Cook until mixture is very thick, 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat.
3. Taste and season with salt and pepper. TIP: If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer mixture to a baking dish.

#### Finish & Serve:
1. Top beef filling with an even layer of mashed potatoes, leaving a gap around edge of pan. Evenly sprinkle with cheddar.
2. Broil until browned, 3-4 minutes. TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning.
3. Serve directly from pan.
