Ingredients
1 yellow onion
12 oz yukon gold potatoes
1 old bay seasoning
2 tbsp mayo
2 tbsp ketchup
2 tsp dijon mustard
10 oz ground beef
1/2 cup white cheddar cheese
2 potato buns
4 tsp vegetable oil
1 tsp sugar
salt
pepper

Potatoes
1. Adjust rack to top position. Heat oven to 425 degrees.
2. Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch thick wedges. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.
3. Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil and half the old bay seasoning. Season lightly with salt and pepper (there's salt in the old bay seasoning).
4. Roast on top rack until browned and crispy (20-25 minutes).

Onion
1. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a medium, preferable nonstick pan over medium high heat. Add onion and cook stirring occasionally until browned and softened (8-10 minutes).
2. Add 1 tsp sugar and a slash of water. Cook until caramelized (2-3 minutes). Season with salt and pepper.
3. Turn off heat and transfer to a small bowl

Sauce
1. In a second bowl, combine mayo ketchup, mustard, and as much of the remaining old bay seasoning as you want. Set aside

Patties
1. Form beef into two equal sized balls. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for onion over medium high heat. Once pan is hot, add beef. Firmly flatten each ball with a spatula to create very thin patties.
3. Cok to desired doneness (3-4 minutes) per side. In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top patties with white cheddar and cover until melted. Remove from heat.

Serve
1. Half and toast buns.
2. Divide buns between plates and fill with patties, onion, and half the special sauce.
3. Serve old bay fries on the side with remaining sauce for dipping.
