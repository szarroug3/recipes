### Ingredients:
- 2 unit scallions
- 9 oz fully cooked chicken breasts
- 1 tbsp southwest spice blend
- 2 unit flour tortillas
- 1/2 cup pepper jack cheese
- 1/4 cup monterey jack cheese
- 1 tsp hot sauce
- 4 tbsp smoky red pepper crema
- salt
- pepper
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 2 tsp vegetable oil

### Instructions:
### Prep Scallions
1. Wash and dry produce.
2. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.

Cook Filling
1. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels. Thinly slice crosswise into strips.
2. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken, scallion whites, and Southwest Spice. Cook until chicken is warmed through and scallions are slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Turn off heat; remove from pan and set aside. Wash out pan.

Assemble Quesadillas
1. Place tortillas on a clean work surface. Evenly sprinkle pepper jack onto one half of each tortilla. Top with chicken filling, then sprinkle with Monterey Jack. Fold tortillas in half to create quesadillas.
2. Heat a large drizzle of oil in pan used for filling over medium heat. Add quesadillas and cook until tortillas are golden brown and cheeses have melted, 3-4 minutes. TIP: Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to work in batches.

Finish & Serve
1. Cut quesadillas into wedges and divide between plates. Sprinkle with scallion greens and drizzle with hot sauce if desired. Serve with smoky red pepper crema on the side.
