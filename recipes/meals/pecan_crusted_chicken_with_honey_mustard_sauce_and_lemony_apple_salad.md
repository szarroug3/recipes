### Ingredients:
- 1/2 oz pecans
- 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tbsp fry seasoning
- 2 tsp dijon mustard
- 2 tsp honey
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 10 oz chicken cutlets
- 1 unit apple
- 1 unit lemon
- 2 oz mixed greens
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp cooking oil
- 1 tbsp butter
- salt
- pepper

### Instructions:
#### Prep:
1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Finely chop pecans (or crush in their bag with a heavy pan or rolling pin).

#### Make Crust:
1. Place 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Let cool slightly, then stir in pecans, panko, half the Fry Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper.

#### Make Sauce:
1. In a small bowl, combine honey, mustard, and mayonnaise.

#### Cook Chicken:
1. Pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season with remaining Fry Seasoning, salt, and pepper. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet.
2. Evenly spread tops of chicken with a thin layer of honey mustard sauce (reserve remaining sauce for serving). Mound with pecan mixture, pressing firmly to adhere (no need to coat the undersides).
3. Roast on middle rack until crust is golden brown and chicken is cooked through, 15-20 minutes.

#### Make Salad:
1. Meanwhile, halve, core, and thinly slice apple. Quarter lemon.
2. In a large bowl, toss mixed greens and apple with a large drizzle of olive oil and as much lemon juice as you like. Season with salt and pepper.

#### Serve:
1. Divide chicken and salad between plates. Drizzle chicken with reserved honey mustard sauce. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.
