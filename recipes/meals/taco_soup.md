### Ingredients:
- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 small yellow onion (optional)
- 1 can of whole kernel corn (not sweet corn)
- 1 can of green beans (any cut will do)
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- 1 can of Rotel brand diced tomatoes with green chilies
- 1 can of kidney beans (preferably dark red)
- 2 packs of Old El Paso brand taco seasoning (1 packet required for beef. Second packet optional for additional seasoning and spiciness.)
- Garlic powder
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1/4 cup Water

Optional Toppings:
Sour Cream
Shredded Cheese
Corn Chips

Directions:
Veggies:
1. In a medium-sized pot, dump both cans of tomatoes with juices and water.
2. Strain kidney beans, green beans, and corn and add those to the pot.
3. Add 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to the pot.
4. Stir until mixed and set aside.

Beef:
1. Chop onion into small pieces.
2. In a pan, place ground beef, season lightly with salt and pepper, and generously with garlic powder.
3. Add beef and onion to pan and cook until beef is cooked and onion pieces are slightly translucent.
4. Strain off the grease.
5. Return beef and onions to the pan and add one packet of taco seasoning and follow the directions on the taco seasoning packet.
6. When finished, add your taco beef mixture to the pot of veggies and stir until mixed.

Finishing up:
1. Put the pot on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil.
2. After it starts boiling, quickly give it a stir, cover the pot with a lid, then set the heat to low.
3. Allow soup to simmer on low for 30 mins, stirring occasionally. (You don't have to stir, but I suggest giving it at least one stir about 15 mins in.)
4. Take a taste of the liquid. If it's too salty or spicy, add up to half a cup of water, mix, and return to the stove for 10 mins on low to simmer. If needed, add from the 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, mix, and return to the stove for 10 mins on low to simmer.

Serve:
Top with shredded cheese, sour cream, and crushed corn chips.
