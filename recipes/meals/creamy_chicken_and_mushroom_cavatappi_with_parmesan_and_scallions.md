- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
- 2 tsp olive oil

### Instructions:
### Prep
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Trim and thinly slice mushrooms. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince or grate garlic.

Cook Pasta
1. Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes.
2. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water, then drain.

Cook Mushrooms
1. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil and 1 TBSP butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 2-3 minutes.
2. Push to one side of pan; add another drizzle of olive oil to empty side.

Cook Chicken
1. While mushrooms cook, pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with Italian Seasoning, salt, and pepper.
2. Once mushrooms are browned and softened, add chicken to empty side of pan; cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.
3. Stir in scallion whites and garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 minute.

Make Sauce
1. Add cream sauce base and stock concentrate to pan. (TIP: Cut top off cream sauce carton to open fully; transfer contents using a spoon or spatula to scrape sauce from carton sides.) Stir to combine.
2. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Season with salt and pepper.

Finish & Serve
1. Add drained cavatappi, half the Parmesan, and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) to pan; toss to coat. If needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
2. Divide between bowls; top with scallion greens and remaining Parmesan. Serve.
