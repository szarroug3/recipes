### Ingredients:
- 12 oz yukon gold potatoes
- 1 unit green bell pepper
- 1 unit yellow onion
- 1 tbsp fry seasoning
- 10 oz ground beef
- 2 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tsp dijon mustard
- 2 unit demi baguette
- 1 unit beef stock concentrate
- 1/2 cup pepper jack cheese
- 1/2 cup cheddar cheese
- 1 tsp hot sauce
- salt
- pepper
- 4 tsp vegetable oil

### Instructions:
#### Prep:
1. Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Halve, core, and thinly slice bell pepper into strips. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.

#### Roast Veggies:
1. Toss potatoes on one side of a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, half the Fry Seasoning (you’ll use the rest in the next step), salt, and pepper.
2. Toss bell pepper on empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper.
3. Roast on top rack until golden brown and tender, 20-22 minutes. (For 4 servings, divide between 2 sheets; roast potatoes on top rack and bell peppers on middle rack.)
4. Remove veggies from sheet.

#### Cook Onion & Beef:
1. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until browned and softened, 5-7 minutes.
2. Add beef* and remaining Fry Seasoning; season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. (If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out.)

#### Make Creamy Mustard & Toast Baguettes:
1. While onion and beef cook, in a small bowl, combine sour cream with half the mustard (you’ll use the rest in the next step). Season with salt and pepper.
2. Slice baguettes lengthwise, stopping before you get all the way through.
3. Toast cut sides up in oven until lightly golden, 3-5 minutes.

#### Make Filling:
1. Once beef is cooked through, stir in stock concentrate, remaining mustard, and 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings).
2. Top beef mixture with pepper jack; cover pan until cheese melts, 1-2 minutes.

#### Finish & Serve:
1. Fill baguettes with beef filling and roasted bell pepper. Place cut sides up on sheet used for veggies; sprinkle with cheddar.
2. Bake until cheese melts, 2-3 minutes.
3. Divide sandwiches and potato wedges between plates. Top sandwiches with hot sauce if desired. Serve with creamy mustard on the side for dipping.
