## Secret Taco Beef
### Ingredients:
1-2 lbs. Skirt Steak
1 tsp. Chile Powder
1 Lime
1 tsp. Brown Sugar
1 Tbsp. Fajita Seasoning (or Taco Seasoning or Some Shit((Some Shit = Black Pepper, Cumin, Paprika, Cayenne, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder?))
Maybe Some Salt and Pepper, but Maybe Not (Depending on the Fajita Seasoning)
Splash of Olive Oil
High Smoke Point Cooking Oil (Canola, Peanut, Ghee, etc.)

### Instructions:
1. Add Olive Oil to Steak and rub to coat (important, Skirt Steak has crannies).
2. Sprinkle on Chile Powder, Brown Sugar, and Fajita Seasoning evenly across the Steak.
3. Squeeze 1/4-1/2 of the Lime over the Steak.
4. Place Steak in airtight container or bag, or wrap in plastic wrap and let marinate for 1-2 hours.
5. Heat Cooking Oil to sizzling (fuck if I know how hot, I wing it. If it's smoking before you add anything, it's too hot).
6. Add Steak and cook 3-5 minutes per side (until well browned, the sugar should help speed up the maillard and carmelization reactions on the surface, be careful to not burn it).
7. Remove steak from heat and another 1/4-1/2 of the Lime over the top.
8. Add some additional seasoning to taste (probably either a sprinkle of salt and pepper or more Fajita seasoning).
9. Wrap Steak in foil and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
10. Cut Steak into thin slices PERPENDICULAR to the grain of the meat.
11. If Steak is too rare after sliced, re-wrap in foil and place in oven for 5-10 minutes until slices are at desired doneness.

## Secret Taco Chicken
### Ingredients:
1-2 lbs. Chicken Breast or Boneless, Skinless Thighs (Breast probably better for this)
1-2 Jalapeno Peppers (or maybe Bell Pepper or some shit if you're a complete wuss)
2-6 Cloves of Garlic
4-6 Cherry Tomatoes OR 2 Medium Plum/Roma Tomatoes, OR 1 Large Tomato (or some canned stuff, IDK) OR OR OR some Tomatillos for Something Fancy
1/2 of a Sweet or White Onion (NOT FUCKING YELLOW)
1 Tbsp. of Brown Sugar
1 Cup of Meat Stock (Prefer Chicken Bouillon ((Knorr Caldo con sabor de Pollo GOATed))
1 Tbsp. Fajita Seasoning (maybe)
Splash of Olive Oil
1 Lime
Maybe Some Salt and Pepper (you know the drill)
1 tsp. Chile Powder
Cooking Oil (anything really)

### Instructions:
1. Add Chicken to Instant Pot and lightly coat with Olive Oil (drizzle is fine).
2. Sprinkle Brown Sugar, Fajita Seasoning, Maybe Salt and Pepper, and Chile Powder over the top of the Chicken in an even coat.
3. Allow to rest while you do the other things (15 mins - 24 hours).
4. In a skillet, begin heating cooking oil to sizzling temp.
5. Either mince Onion or slice finely into strips.
6. When oil is hot, add Onion to pan.
7. After Onion begins to brown, sprinkle a small amount of brown sugar over the top to promote browning.
8. While onions are cooking, mince Pepper(s) or cut into thin strips.
9. Cook Onions until translucent and beginning to brown, but not caramelized.
10. Add Peppers to the cooking onions and continue to cook until fragrant and Onions are beginning to caramelize (google it if you don't know what that looks like).
11. Remove from heat and add to the Chicken pot.
12. Slice Tomatoes into chunks, mince Garlic, and add both to the Chicken pot.
13. Add enough Meat Stock for Instant Pot to function (~1 cup).
14. Cook on high pressure for 15-20 minutes.
15. Remove ONLY THE CHICKEN from the Instant Pot and shred with 2 forks (google it).
16. Optionally add some of the remaining cooking liquid and/or additional Lime and/or Fajita Seasoning and/or Salt/Pepper to the shredded Chicken to taste.

### Something Fancy
1. Take all the remaining goodies in the Instant Pot and add to a medium stock pot on the stove.
2. Probably add an additional portion of minced Onion, Garlic, and Tomatoes or Tomatillos to the pot.
3. Heat to simmering and then blend (ideally with immersion (stick) blender).
4. Cook down or add additional Meat Stock/water to desired texture.
5. Salt to taste.
6. You now have some homemade salsa or salsa verde (verde works way better this way).
