### Ingredients:
- 12 oz yukon gold ptoatoes
- 6 oz asparagus
- 1/4 oz chives
- 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs


12 oz yukon gold potatoes
6 oz asparagus
1/4 oz chives
1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tbsp fry seasoning
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
10 oz chicken cutlets
2 tbsp mayonnaise
2 tbsp sour cream
1 tsp olive oil
2 tbsp butter
1 tsp vegetable oil
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Prep Potatoes and Asparague:
1. Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Wash and dry all produce.
3. Dice potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces.
4. Trim and discard woody bottom ends from asparagus.
5. Finely chop chives.

Chicken:
1. Place 1 TBSP butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 30 seconds.
2. Stir in panko, half the Fry Seasoning, half the cheddar (you’ll use the rest of the seasoning and cheese later), salt, and pepper.
3. Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season with remaining Fry Seasoning, salt, and pepper. Place on one side of prepared sheet
4. Evenly spread a thin layer of mayonnaise onto tops of chicken (you might not use all the mayo); mound with panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides).
5. Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (you’ll add the asparagus then).

Cook Potatoes:
1. While chicken roasts, place potatoes in a large pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches.
2. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes.
3. Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes to pot. Keep covered off heat until ready to mash.

Roast Asparagus & Finish Chicken:
1. Once chicken has roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven.
2. Carefully toss asparagus on empty side with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper.
3. Continue roasting until asparagus is tender and chicken is cooked through, 10-12 minutes more. TIP: For a deeply golden crust, broil chicken for the last 2-3 minutes.

Mash Potatoes
1. To pot with drained potatoes, add sour cream, remaining cheddar, and 1 TBSP butter. Mash until smooth and creamy, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed.
2. Stir in half the chives. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve
1. Divide chicken, potatoes, and asparagus between plates. Top potatoes with remaining bacon and remaining chives. Serve.
