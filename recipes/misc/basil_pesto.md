- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (optional)
- 1/3 cup pine nuts (cashews and walnuts alos make a nice pesto)
- 3 garlic cloves (minced)
- salt
- pepper

Directions:
1. Put basil, garlic and nuts in a food processor and pulse until everything is chopped.
2. Add the olive oil and parmesan, if using, and pulse again until smooth.
3. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Enjoy immediately or make a bigger batch and freeze the leftovers.

Notes:
Ice cube trays make a good vessel to freeze the finished pesto. Simply pour the pesto in the small cubes and freeze. When making a recip with pesto, thaw a couple of cubes and you've got your pesto.
